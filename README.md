# wer-sigtest
Script to perform statistical significance test between ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) transcription hypotheses. This can be used to evaluate whether differences in WER (word error rate) are actually significant or not.

## Install

You will need to use the comands `sclite` and `sc_stats` from the NIST Scoring Toolkit available here:
http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/Speech/docs/sctk-1.2/sctk.htm


## Files

**RUN.sh** contains an example script to (1) generate an SGML (XML-like) file for transcript hypotheses you want to compare, and (2) to compare the hypotheses using a statistical significance test of your choice. The repo contains:

- ref.trn : A **reference** (ground truth) transcript in the format of <transcript line> <unique line ID>.
- hyp.A.trn and hyp.B.trn : Two transcript **hypthoses** each generated by different ASR setups.
  
### Generate SGML file.
